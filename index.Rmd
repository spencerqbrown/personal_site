### About Me

Currently in my fourth (and final) year of my undergraduate career as a data science student. In addition to coursework, I have spent (and continue to spend) a lot of time independently learning data science skills and tools like Python (plus Pandas, sklearn, etc), SQL, and R to name a few. In my current remote position with the University of Iowa Marketing Department, I scrape, clean, and later analyze restaurant review data from Google Reviews, generally using Python (numpy, pandas) code with a hint of Excel.
